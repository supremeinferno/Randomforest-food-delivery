---

## Overview

DeliverIQ predicts food delivery times based on order, traffic, weather, and courier-related factors.

The project explores machine learning techniques for estimating delivery duration and uses a tuned Random Forest Regressor to generate predictions. The goal is to simulate a real-world logistics problem where accurate delivery estimates can improve customer experience and operational efficiency.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains **1000 delivery records** with the following features:

* Distance (km)
* Weather Conditions
* Traffic Level
* Time of Day
* Vehicle Type
* Preparation Time (minutes)
* Courier Experience (years)

Target Variable:

* Delivery Time (minutes)

## Data Preprocessing

The following steps were performed:

* Data Cleaning
* Categorical Feature Encoding
* Feature Transformation
* Train-Test Split
* Hyperparameter Optimization using RandomizedSearchCV

## Model Development

The following model was trained:

| Model                   | Purpose     |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Random Forest Regressor | Final Model |

### Best Parameters

```python
{
    'max_depth': 11,
    'max_features': 3,
    'min_samples_leaf': 3,
    'min_samples_split': 3,
    'n_estimators': 781
